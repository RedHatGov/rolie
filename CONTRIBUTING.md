## Contributing to this GitHub repository

This project uses a typical GitHub fork and pull request [workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). To establish a development environment for contributing to the project, you must do the following:

1. Fork the repository to your personal workspace. Please refer to the Github [guide on forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for more details.
1. Create a feature branch from the master branch for making changes. You can [create a branch in your personal repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) directly on GitHub or create the branch using a Git client. For example, the ```git branch working``` command can be used to create a branch named *working*.
1. You will need to make your modifications by adding, removing, and changing the content in the branch, then staging your changes using the ```git add``` and ```git rm``` commands.

The commit message should describe the nature of your changes (e.g., added new feature X which supports Y). You can also reference an issue from the project repository by using the hash symbol.
